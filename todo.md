# Project TODO

- [x] Define a pseudonymised patient data model using a non-identifying Research ID and no direct identifiers.
- [x] Add consent and study-enrolment status fields with controlled values.
- [x] Add cohort-specific clinical data for Stroke, Myasthenia Gravis, Guillain–Barré Syndrome, and Myopathy.
- [x] Restrict registry functions to authenticated users and separate administrator-only actions.
- [x] Create an immutable-style audit trail for patient record creation and modification events.
- [x] Build a secure English-language registry dashboard with cohort totals and clinical status summaries.
- [x] Build a searchable, filterable patient registry with cohort and core-variable filters.
- [x] Build a structured patient record form with cohort-specific sections and validation.
- [x] Create a de-identified CSV research export that excludes direct and quasi-identifying fields.
- [x] Add user-access management controls for administrators.
- [x] Add tests for validation, authorization, de-identification, and registry query-filter inputs; database integration tests are deferred because the project has no isolated non-production test database.
- [x] Verify desktop and mobile UI rendering, run tests, and prepare a delivery checkpoint.
